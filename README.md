# Interview-Task

This repository contains the solution for three interview tasks.

## Task 1
This task is about loading a JSON file, filtering the data based on book category and publish data, increasing the prices and finally writing the result to a new CSV file.
After completing the initial sak, I have added functionality to allow the user to input the varaibles that will be used for the program.

## Task 2
This task had the same ask as in Task 1, but was to be completed by creating a scenario in MAKE. The MAKE scenario loads the JSON data using a HTTP request, filters the data based on category and publish data through a filter then uses the Math module to increase the prices then converts the data to CSV file and emails the result.

## Task 3
The final task was to create a python script that will read an excel file, convert it to JSON, sort the data based on a specific category, add a new field to the data and finally write the result to a new JSON file.
